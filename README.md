# Shortest Sub List Finder

Given a list of non-negative integers between 0-50,000, find the shortest sub-list with the same degree as the original list.

The degree is defined as the maximum frequency for an element in the list.

E.g.

[1, 2, 2, 3, 1] has the degree 2 (because both 1 and 2 exist twice in the list). The solution for this list is [2, 2] as it is the shortest sub-list with the same degree.
